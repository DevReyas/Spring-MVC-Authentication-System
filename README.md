# Spring MVC Authentication System
### This project is a simple authentication system built using the Spring MVC framework without a database. It provides essential user authentication features, including:

# Features:
✅ User Signup – Register new users.
✅ User Login – Authenticate existing users.
✅ Logout – End user sessions.
✅ Delete Account – Remove user data.

# Tech Stack:
- Spring MVC – Core framework.
- Spring Boot – Simplifies configuration.
- Spring Security (Optional) – For authentication and session handling.
- JSP & Servlets – For frontend rendering.
- Bundle (Offline)–(maven Dependencies are download and bundled together to create library).
**How It Works:**
- User data is stored in-memory (no database).
- CRUD operations handle authentication and account management.
- Follows MVC architecture for structured development.
- This project showcases Spring's default CRUD operations and authentication workflows in a minimal setup. 🚀
